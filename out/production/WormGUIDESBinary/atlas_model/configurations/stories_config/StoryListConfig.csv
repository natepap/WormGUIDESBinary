Birth of SAAVL,SAAVL is an interneuron and (sublateral) motor neuron in the lateral ganglia of the head. This neuron sends its process anteriorly within the sublateral cords in the head.,sprite,,cell,,ABplpaaaaaa,,,,257,258,,,,,
Birth of SIBDR,SIBDR is an interneuron and (sublateral) motor neuron in the lateral ganglia of the head. This neuron sends its process posteriorly within the sublateral cords.,sprite,,cell,,ABprppaaaaa,,,,258,259,,,,,
Birth of SIBDL,SIBDL is an interneuron and (sublateral) motor neuron in the lateral ganglia of the head. This neuron sends its process posteriorly within the sublateral cords.,sprite,,cell,,ABplppaaaaa,,,,262,263,,,,,
Lim-4 Expression ,"Lim-4 expression is found in 8 neuron pairs.  Single cell outgrowth is characterized for 3 of these cells, SIBDL/R and SAAVL. Uncharacterized cells have their nuclei marked in white.",overlay,,,,,,,,277,287,,,,,
Appearance of Tract Model,"The tract model represents the paths taken by groups of cells labeled by CND-1 and UNC-86 markers. Though traced from visible structures in membrane labeled images the tracts anticipate the topology of the network formed by neural outgrowth, e.g. the amphid commissure tract anticipates the outgrowth of cnd-1 positive cells through the  amphid commissure.",overlay,,,,,,,,295,297,,,,,
Neurite Outgrowth of SIBDL/R Begins,Outgrowth is segmented in an embryo lacking label in most lim-4 cells,callout LR,"38, 0",cell,,ABplppaaaaa,,,,325,326,,,,,
Outgrowth along Tract,The measured lengths of neuron outgrowth from cells individually labeled in different embryos are threaded through tracts. Temporal alignment is based on nuclear positions.,callout UL,"49, 0",cell,,ABprppaaaaa,,,,327,328,,,,,

Outgrowth Asymmetry in L/R Symmetric Pair,"SIBD's-although they are bilaterally symmetrical, they do not travel through the nerve ring at the same rate.",sprite,,cell,,ABplppaaaaa,,,,327,333,,,,,http://scene.wormguides.org/wormguides/testurlscript?/set/sibd-n$@+#ffe6ccff/view/time=359/rX=59.0/rY=13.0/rZ=0.0/tX=-14.0/tY=18.0/scale=1.5/dim=0.25/browser/
Multicellular Structure,"When single cell data are not available, outgrowth can be segmented and displayed that is reliably  assigned to a small set of cells that grow into the tract. The relative locations of cells within the structure remain unknown. ",callout UL,"73, 0",cell,,ABprpappaaa,,,,350,351,,,,,
Fasciculation of SIBDL and AIYL,Both cells are traveling into the nerve ring together,callout LR,"79, 0",cell,,ABplpapaaap,,,,335,340,,,,,
Multiple Cells Within a Tract,"To maximize the visibility of individual cell data in the same tract, neurites are drawn as 'pipes' routed through tracts in relative positions that are based on relative sorting of markers when available, but are arbitrary in an absolute spatial sense.

Nerve Ring Closure,SAAVL crosses the midline. The closure of the nerve ring generally occurs between the comma to 1.5 fold stages.,callout UL,"33, 0",cell,,ABplpaaaaaa,,,,357,376,,,,,
