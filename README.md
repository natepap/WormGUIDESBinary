# WormGUIDESBinary

Expands upon the WormGUIDES software created by [zhirongbaolab](https://www.github.com/zhirongbaolab) by incorporating the Binary naming system created by Dr. James Michaelson. In addition to using the traditional names of C. Elegans cells, WormGUIDESBinaryalso assigns binary names to the individual cells, and displays them alongside the traditional names. Searchfunctionality for the binary names has also been implemented, as well as a binary lineage tree for better visualization.
